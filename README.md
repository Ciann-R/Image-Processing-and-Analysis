### Abstract:

"The ability to adequately process and analyse image
data is of the essence of machine and computer vision,
particularly in contexts where autonomous machine
perception and perhaps artificial conceptualisation is
patently required. On this basis, the applications for
such vary extensively, from the automation of machinery in the industrial sector, to contemporary research
regarding complex artificial intelligence systems. Moreover, the ability to process and analyse digital image
data is paramount in contexts which require human interpretation of image data. Sufficient image refinement,
enhancement or manipulation is a necessity for extracting relevant data within these human-machine interfaces. Such applications in this context are seen ubiquitously in all sectors. Some notable examples include:
Medical imaging such as MRI/X-ray imagery, weather
forecasting and UV sensing, encoding and transmission
of image data and even mapping extensive topological
surfaces on neighbouring planets [1][2]. So, conclusively
speaking, one could make the assertion that digital image processing is an irrefutable linchpin in the symbiotic
evolution of man and machine.
In this document, I explore some of the rudimentary
techniques associated with digital image processing and
analysis. The input images were provided by the lecturer
preparatory to the conduction of the assignment, with
the exception of one input image, which was provided by
myself. This project was conducted via the Jupyter notebook (v.6.3.0) IDE and most notably, in conjunction with
the Scikit-image (v.0.18.3) library [3]. The Sci-kit image
library provides all the relevant algorithms required to
process the input images. The project was segmented
into three parts. with the first part involving rudimentary resizing, converting and filtering techniques of a
raw input image provided by myself. Noise was added to
the image which then relevant filters were applied to remove the supplemented noise. The second part involved
creating a robust, fully automated and data-driven
code to extract the smallest scissors from the input image. A series of techniques were employed in order to
reduce the input image to a binary image, clear the borders and detect the relevant objects (scissors) within the
image, in order to compute their relative centroids and
areas and extract the smallest one. Once completed, a
stress test demonstrating the codes ’robustness’ was
created by implementing varying degrees of noise. The
third and final part of the project involved colour matching of a reference image provided by the lecturer with a
source image, which was no other than the input image
provided in part. 1. The histograms of each image were
plotted and analysed. Explicit detail of each procedure
is undertaken in sec. 4."
